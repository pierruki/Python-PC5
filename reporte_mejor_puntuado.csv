45798,US,"Tasted in a flight of great and famous Napa wines, this Cardinale stood at the head of the pack. Starts with a very fine nose of cedar, cassis, ripe blackberries and violets, then turns dramatic and refined in the mouth. Shows vast depth and length, with the finish a full minute of sweet fruits and spices. Marvelous tannins, so plush and elegant, so powerful yet refined. The grapes hail from Mt. Veeder, Howell Mountain, Stags Leap and Oakville, and the blend contains 14% Merlot. As good as it is now, it will improve for at least eight years.",,100,200.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,Cardinale 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,Cardinale,América,Muy Alto,0.5
7335,Italy,"Thick as molasses and dark as caramelized brown sugar, the wine oozes out of the bottle releasing concentrated aromas of butterscotch, toffee, honey, licorice, coffee, resin and maple syrup. Grapes from the Montepulciano area are dried in a ventilated room and the wine ages over 10 years in tiny oak barrels resulting in thick, dark concentration. Don't pair it with food: Vin Santo as good as this deserves to be enjoyed alone, as a so-called “meditation wine.”",Occhio di Pernice,100,210.0,Tuscany,Vin Santo di Montepulciano,,,,Avignonesi 1995 Occhio di Pernice  (Vin Santo di Montepulciano),Prugnolo Gentile,Avignonesi,Europa,Muy Alto,0.47619047619047616
345,Australia,"This wine contains some material over 100 years old, but shows no signs of fragility. Instead, it's concentrated through age and should hold in the bottle indefinitely. It's dark coffee-brown in color, with delectable aromas of rancio, dried fig, molasses and black tea, yet despite enormous concentration avoids excessive weight. And it's amazingly complex and fresh on the nearly endless finish.",Rare,100,350.0,Victoria,Rutherglen,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Rare Muscat (Rutherglen),Muscat,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards,Oceanía,Muy Alto,0.2857142857142857
9912,South Africa,"Only 95 cases were made of this Bordeaux-style blend of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Malbec and 24% Cabernet Franc. It's a stellar example of the high-end and highly cellarable wines that can come out of South Africa, oozing with depth, concentration and complexity, all in a harmonious, balanced package. It's dark and brooding right off the bat, boasting firm, tight blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit that's coupled with hints of raspberry sauce, pressed violets and baking spice. The palate is strong and packed with black fruit flavors that lead into a long, evolving finish of char, espresso bean, cigar and woodspice. Firmly structured and robust in feel, try from 2022–2028, though it could mature well even beyond.",Book 17 XVII,95,330.0,Stellenbosch,,,Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz,De Toren 2014 Book 17 XVII Red (Stellenbosch),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,De Toren,África,Muy Alto,0.2878787878787879
